Big thanks to Mitsurugi_w, Darksoft, and Brizzo of Arcade Projects for finally allowing this to be published.

# Stage One: Eye for an Eye!!
Not once since the Montreal Screwjob have WWE / WWF fans had to endure such an atrocity as we just witnessed... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Screwjob<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ArcadeHustle/X3_Multi_Eye_for_an_Eye/blob/master/screwjob.jpg">

In an unprecidented refusal, Mitsurugi_w & Darksoft have NOT accepted the Eye for an Eye challenge issued by Rey Mysterio on behalf of the Arcade Hustle tag team. 
Seemingly afraid of the fact that the Arcade Hustle team would have taken "both their eyes", the Darkdawg Arcade team spokesman Mitsu remains silent to this day 
regarding the proposal to have an Eye for an Eye match. 

Mysterio even came out of recovery to make the announcemnt, Darkdawg Arcade team still snubbed his offer!<br>

</p>

Rumor has it that fears of COVID19 are what Mitsu and Dark are hanging their hats on as opposed to admiting their fear. Having nearly lost Brizzo earlier in the year after 
he announced that he had "got home from <his> last trip for the year on Nov 25, and <has> been beyond sick since", the Darkdawg team seems weary to lose any steam.

WWE Ryback did say "Now is the time for ALL wrestling talent to stand together and refuse to perform", but this does not make the refusal any less disrespectful in this case!

Even though Mitsurugi_w, Darksoft, and their ringside manager Brizzo all continue to refuse to perform, we know the show must go on! After the sickening Darkdawg Arcade team refusal to participate in the Eye for an Eye Match, the only thing to make it right will be for an X3 multi to be released.

# Stage 1 

The Mitsu+Dark Eye for an Eye match had been a long time coming... It is a shame the team has snubbed the match. Just over a year ago the roots of this release were shared in it's sister writeup. https://github.com/ArcadeHustle/X3_USB_softmod. 

Immediately after the writeup came out, the Darkdawg arcade team began throwing salt as if Mr. Fuji had come out of retirement. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Fuji. Fuji, not at all unlike Brizzo was famous for often throwing salt in the eyes of fan favorite wrestlers!<br>

Not fully understanding the technical relevance of the last release Mitsu began claiming it was "incomplete", as well as "fake".
The git repo was deemed to be nothing more than "incomplete info about enabling file sharing access on an old outdated version of windows 7."
There was a challenge that "If you read that github page and come out of it with a working multi then let us know". 
Of course, although it was fake, it was reaffirmed "The info itself is not new or special. It's all over the web anyways".

Ekorz or course can spot a fake from a mile away, and also declared the information appropriately as such: "itâ€™s fake"
https://www.arcade-projects.com/forums/index.php?thread/10038-fake-arcade-projects-twitter-account/&postID=161785#post161785

Someon accepted the challenge over a year ago, and this fake work casually began, now a year later is has been casually completed.

In the mean time private sales of NXL2 games have increased in private messages & DM's on Arcade Projects, UKVAC, and Facebook.

Sales kicked up so quickly that the Taito X3 forum on Arcade Projects needed to be deleted with malice!

Lets pour out some liquor for it, just like we did the Sega Ringedge, Ringwide and Nu subgroup before it! May they both Rest In Peace!<br>

Profits have increased during the transtion from private sales of USF4, to private sales of SFV and Samurai Showdown as a newer alternative. 

"P&D runs on lower spec hardware but can be converted to USF4 by some people."

Both SFV & Samurai Showdown drives debuted for 1000euro earlier this year in May!

# Stage 2 

Lets cut to the chase... making a multi on X3 is simple. First you are going to need to get into the bios. You may think to try "open says a me!" as the password, instead
I suggest "open you" in Norweigan instead. https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=opent%20deg

The key sequence to get into the BIOS has been previosuly been disclosed for other Taito X pedigrees. The same sequence works on X3. 
Ctrl + Alt + F9

The password was recoverd via a known technique with the help of UEFITool. 
https://gist.github.com/en4rab/550880c099b5194fbbf3039e3c8ab6fd

https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool
Pulled from UEFITool out of nvram:

XOR key:
5B93B62611BA6C4DC7E022747D07D89A332E8EC1E95444E89F7BFA0E55A2B0350BC9665CC1EF1C83

This translates to: opentdeg 

With this password you simply need to disable the onboard security checks

# Stage 3 

Without further delay, the multi image in both Yoko, and Tate... 

Have fun! Be safe! We will be back with more soon.

Simply enter the password shown above in the BIOS.<br>
